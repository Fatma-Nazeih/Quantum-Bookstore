# Quantum-Bookstore

This program is an Online Bookstore Management System named Quantum Bookstore. It allows managing various types of books such as paper books, eBooks, and showcase books. The system supports operations like adding new books to the inventory, buying books using their ISBN, removing outdated books, and printing all available books. Each action outputs messages prefixed with "Quantum book store:" for clarity. Paper books are shipped to a given address, eBooks are sent via email, and showcase books are not for sale. The system is designed to be easily extendable to support new types of books.
